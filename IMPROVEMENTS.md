## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to transform the Scholarix Telesales application into a world-class, production-ready system with solid features and realistic approaches based on research.

## 1. Recording System Overhaul

### Problems Fixed

```

## 4. Enhanced Scripts - More Conversational

### Problems Fixed
- ‚ùå Some script language felt salesy or robotic
- ‚ùå Could sound more natural and authentic
- ‚ùå Needed warmer, consultative tone

### Solutions Implemented (`src/lib/scholarixScript.ts`)

#### A. Opening (Start Node)
**BEFORE**: "Good morning! Mr. [NAME]? This is [YOUR NAME] from Scholarix..."

- "Let me be straight" instead of "I'll be straight" (more consultative)

**Changes**:
- Added "interesting" (builds curiosity)
