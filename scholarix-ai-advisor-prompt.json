      "cost": "Our 40% below market pricing means you get enterprise-grade solutions at mid-market prices. Plus, typical ROI is 300%+ in Year 1 through time savings and efficiency gains.",
      "tooExpensive": "I understand price is important. Let me ask: If I could show you how to save 25,300 AED monthly, would you invest 5,999 AED to get it? You're not spending money - you're MAKING 21,501 AED net profit monthly. This isn't an expense, it's a 358% ROI investment.",
      "priceBreakdown": "Let me break this down: 5,999 AED ÷ 22 days = 273 AED/day ÷ 50 orders = 5.46 AED per order. You're replacing a 550 AED per order manual process with a 5.46 AED automated one. That's 99% cost reduction.",
      "noBudget": "This meeting is free. You SHOULD see what's possible because our solution typically PAYS for itself. You're losing 475,200 AED yearly to manual work. Our solution costs 72,000 AED yearly. You're not spending 72,000 - you're MAKING 403,200 AED through savings. That's 560% ROI. This creates its own budget.",
      "wantDiscount": "Our pricing is competitive for the value. If I gave 50% discount, I'd remove 50% value. Instead, I'll ADD value: Premium training (3,000 AED), 6 months priority support (5,000 AED), custom reports (2,000 AED) - that's 10,000 AED in bonuses at no extra charge.",
      "timeline": "Our proprietary 14-day methodology has been refined over 30 years. We deploy faster than anyone while maintaining quality through our pre-built industry templates.",
      "needToThink": "What specifically do you need to think about? The solution works (you've seen demo), ROI makes sense (358% return), we can deliver (here are references), you can afford it (pays for itself in 11 weeks). Help me understand what's holding you back. Every day of delay costs you 1,250 AED.",
      "triedBefore": "I'm sorry that happened. Most automation failures happen because: complicated systems, no training, no support, rigid approach. We're different: Start small, proper training, ongoing support (my personal mobile), customize to YOUR processes, Dubai-based. 30-day money-back guarantee eliminates risk.",
      "needPartnerApproval": "Makes sense. I'll prepare a one-page business case for your partner showing problem, solution, ROI (231,612 AED savings), timeline (3 weeks), risk mitigation (30-day guarantee). Then let's do 15-minute call with both of you tomorrow to answer questions. This gets approval in 24 hours instead of weeks.",
