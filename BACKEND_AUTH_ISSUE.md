# Backend Authentication Issue - Temporary Status

## Current Situation

The app is experiencing "Failed to load calls from server" because Clerk JWT verification in the worker is failing.

### What's Working ✅
- ✅ CORS properly configured
- ✅ Worker deployed and running
- ✅ Health endpoint responding
- ✅ D1 database active
- ✅ R2 storage configured
- ✅ User sync endpoint public (no auth required)
- ✅ Frontend auto-syncs users on sign-in

### What's Not Working ❌
- ❌ Clerk JWT token verification failing
- ❌ Backend API calls returning 401 Unauthorized
- ❌ Calls not syncing to cloud database

## Root Cause

The worker is trying to verify Clerk JWTs using:
```typescript
fetch('https://api.clerk.com/v1/tokens/verify', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${CLERK_SECRET_KEY}` },
  body: JSON.stringify({ token })
})
```

This endpoint either:
1. Doesn't exist / has changed
2. Requires different authentication
3. Needs a different approach (JWKS-based verification)

## Correct Solution

Clerk recommends using `@clerk/backend` package for server-side verification:

```typescript
import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/backend';

// Verify session token
const session = await clerkClient.sessions.verifySession({
  sessionId,
  token
});
```

Or use JWKS-based verification with the Clerk public key.

## Temporary Workaround Options

### Option 1: Trust Mode (DEV ONLY)
Skip token verification temporarily, just check token exists:
```typescript
// TEMPORARY - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION
if (token && token.length > 20) {
  // Extract user ID from token (it's a JWT)
  const payload = JSON.parse(atob(token.split('.')[1]));
  const clerkUserId = payload.sub;
  // ... rest of logic
}
```

### Option 2: Sync-Only Mode
Keep using localStorage, make backend optional:
- Calls save to localStorage (works now)
- Backend sync optional (fails gracefully)
- User doesn't see errors
- Add "Upload to cloud" button for manual sync later

### Option 3: Direct D1 Access (Client-side)
Use Cloudflare Pages Functions (not Workers) with D1 binding:
- Pages Functions have direct Clerk integration
- No JWT verification needed
- Simpler auth flow

## Recommended Immediate Action

**Use Option 2** - Make backend truly optional:

1. Change error handling in `CallApp.tsx`:
```typescript
// Don't show error toast on backend failure
// Just silently fall back to localStorage
```

2. Add sync status indicator:
```typescript
// Show badge: "Local only" vs "Cloud synced"
```

3. Add manual sync button:
```typescript
// "Upload to Cloud" button to retry sync
```

This lets users continue working while we fix auth properly.

## Proper Fix (Next Steps)

1. Install `@clerk/backend` in worker:
```bash
npm install @clerk/backend
```

2. Update `functions/index.ts`:
```typescript
import { createClerkClient } from '@clerk/backend';

const clerk = createClerkClient({
  secretKey: c.env.CLERK_SECRET_KEY
});

// Verify token
const { sessionId } = await clerk.authenticateRequest({
  request: c.req.raw
});
```

3. Test with actual Clerk session

4. Deploy and verify

## Status

- **Current:** Backend auth broken, using localStorage only
- **Workaround:** Option 2 (graceful degradation)
- **Proper fix:** ETA 30-60 minutes (install @clerk/backend + test)

## User Impact

**Right now:**
- App works fine with localStorage
- Calls save locally
- No cross-device sync
- No cloud backup

**After workaround:**
- Same as now, but no error messages
- Clear indication of "local only" mode
- Manual sync option when auth is fixed

**After proper fix:**
- Full cloud sync working
- Cross-device access
- 15GB free storage active
- Backend API fully functional

## Test Command

Check if your token is valid:
```bash
# Get your Clerk token from browser console:
# await window.Clerk.session.getToken()

# Test auth endpoint:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://scholarix-crm.renbranmadelo.workers.dev/api/auth/me
```

Expected: 401 with "Clerk verification failed" (current bug)
After fix: 200 with user data
