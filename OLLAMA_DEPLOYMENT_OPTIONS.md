# Railway Ollama Deployment - Alternative Simple Method

If the Dockerfile approach doesn't work, use this method:

## Option 1: Use Railway's Ollama Template
1. Go to https://railway.app/template/ollama
2. Click "Deploy Now"  
3. This will give you a working Ollama instance immediately

## Option 2: Manual Railway Deployment
1. Create new Railway project
2. Connect to GitHub repo: renbran/interactive-sales-ca
3. In Railway settings, change:
   - Root Directory: `/railway`
   - Docker Build Context: `/`
   - Dockerfile Path: `railway/Dockerfile`

## Option 3: Use External Ollama Service
If Railway continues to have issues, we can use:
- **Hugging Face Spaces** (Free tier available)
- **Render** (Good for Docker deployments)  
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**

## Current Configuration:
- Model: llama3.2:3b (smaller, faster for cloud deployment)
- Port: 11434
- CORS: Enabled for all origins
- Host: 0.0.0.0 (accepts external connections)
