# Recording Storage Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Backend (Cloudflare Worker)
- ‚úÖ Created `/api/recordings/upload` endpoint for uploading audio blobs to R2
- ‚úÖ Created `/api/recordings/:filename` endpoint for fetching recordings
- ‚úÖ Created `/api/recordings/:filename` DELETE endpoint for deleting recordings
- ‚úÖ Updated `calls` API to accept `recording_url` and `recording_duration` fields
- ‚úÖ Configured R2 bucket binding in `wrangler.toml`

### 2. Frontend (React)
- ‚úÖ Modified `CallApp.tsx` to store recording blob temporarily
- ‚úÖ Added automatic upload of recording blob before saving call
- ‚úÖ Updated call save to include `recording_url` and `recording_duration`
- ‚úÖ `CallHistory.tsx` already has audio player support for playback

### 3. Database
- ‚úÖ Database schema already has `recording_url` and `recording_duration` columns

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: R2 Setup Required

Before this feature will work, you need to **enable R2 in your Cloudflare dashboard**:

### Step 1: Enable R2
1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Select your account: **Scholarix CRM** (5ca87478e09d6ebc6954f770ac4656e8)
3. Click on **R2** in the left sidebar
4. Click **Enable R2** (if not already enabled)
5. Note: R2 has a generous free tier:
   - 10 GB storage free
   - Class A operations: 1 million/month free
   - Class B operations: 10 million/month free

### Step 2: Create R2 Bucket
Once R2 is enabled, run this command:
```bash
cd /d/salesApp/interactive-sales-ca
npx wrangler r2 bucket create scholarix-recordings
```

### Step 3: Configure CORS (Optional)
If you want recordings to be accessible from the browser, configure CORS:
```bash
npx wrangler r2 bucket cors put scholarix-recordings --config cors.json
```

Create `cors.json`:
```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "https://scholarix-crm.pages.dev",
      "https://interactive-sales-ca.pages.dev"
    ],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
  }
]
```

### Step 4: Deploy Worker
After R2 is enabled and bucket is created:
```bash
cd /d/salesApp/interactive-sales-ca
npx wrangler deploy
```

### Step 5: Deploy Frontend
Commit and push changes to deploy frontend:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add R2 recording storage - upload and persist recordings"
git push origin main
```

## üì± How It Works

### Recording Flow:
1. User starts call ‚Üí Recording starts (microphone access required)
2. User ends call ‚Üí Recording stops, blob is created
3. Recording blob is temporarily stored in browser memory
4. User clicks "Save Call Summary"
5. Recording blob is uploaded to R2 via `/api/recordings/upload`
6. R2 returns permanent URL for the recording
7. Call is saved to database with `recording_url`
8. Recording persists and survives page refresh!

### Playback Flow:
1. User opens Call History
2. Calls with recordings show audio player
3. Click play ‚Üí Audio streams from R2
4. Click download ‚Üí Downloads recording file
5. Recordings are accessible across all devices

## üîß Fallback Behavior

If R2 is not enabled:
- Recording still works locally
- Recording blob is stored in browser (temporary)
- User gets warning: "Recording saved locally but not uploaded to cloud"
- Recording disappears on page refresh (no backend storage)
- Once R2 is enabled, new recordings will be uploaded automatically

## üß™ Testing Checklist

After R2 is enabled and deployed:

- [ ] Start a call with microphone access
- [ ] End call and save with notes
- [ ] Check browser console for "Recording uploaded successfully"
- [ ] Refresh page
- [ ] Open Call History
- [ ] Verify recording is still there
- [ ] Click play button ‚Üí Audio should play
- [ ] Click download ‚Üí Should download .webm file
- [ ] Check Cloudflare dashboard ‚Üí R2 bucket should show uploaded file

## üìä Storage Estimates

Audio recording sizes (per minute):
- Low quality (8kHz): ~60 KB/min
- Medium quality (16kHz): ~120 KB/min  
- High quality (44.1kHz): ~500 KB/min

Current implementation uses 44.1kHz for best quality.

Typical call duration: 5-10 minutes
Typical recording size: 2.5 MB - 5 MB

With R2 free tier (10 GB):
- Can store ~2,000 - 4,000 recordings
- About 400-800 hours of audio

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Enable R2 in Cloudflare Dashboard** ‚Üê DO THIS FIRST
2. Create R2 bucket: `scholarix-recordings`
3. Deploy worker: `npx wrangler deploy`
4. Commit and push frontend changes
5. Test recording ‚Üí save ‚Üí refresh ‚Üí playback
6. Monitor R2 usage in Cloudflare dashboard

## üö® Troubleshooting

**Error: "R2 storage not configured"**
- R2 is not enabled in your Cloudflare account
- Go to dashboard and enable R2

**Error: "Failed to upload recording"**
- Check browser console for detailed error
- Verify worker is deployed with R2 binding
- Check `wrangler.toml` has R2 bucket config

**Recording not showing after refresh**
- Recording upload failed or R2 not enabled
- Check network tab for `/api/recordings/upload` request
- Check response for error message

**Audio player shows but won't play**
- R2 file may not exist (upload failed)
- Check CORS configuration
- Try downloading file instead

## üìù Files Modified

1. `wrangler.toml` - Uncommented R2 bucket binding
2. `functions/api/recordings.ts` - NEW: Recording upload/download API
3. `functions/index.ts` - Added recordings route
4. `functions/api/calls.ts` - Added recording_duration support
5. `src/components/CallApp.tsx` - Added recording blob upload logic
6. `src/lib/types.ts` - Already had R2Bucket type
